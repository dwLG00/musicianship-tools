The objective is to highlight the keys on the piano that you hear played in the recording.
The root note of each recording is highlighted from the start. You can highlight keys by clicking on them on the piano.
Depending on the difficulty, you can replay the audio recording multiple times, or can toggle between playing the recording as a chord or an arpeggio.
When you are done highlighting the keys, press submit to check your answers.
- Green: The correct key was highlighted
- Red: You highlighted this key but it was not played
- Yellow: This key was played, but it was not highlighted.
